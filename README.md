### 4. Create a Fuel Economy Column â›½
- **Task**: Created a `fuel_economy` column as a weighted average of city and highway values.
- **Result**: This column allows for better analysis of fuel efficiency across different vehicles.

### 5. Find Vehicles Above Median Fuel Economy ðŸ“ˆ
- **Task**: Used Boolean masking to find all vehicles with a `fuel_economy` above the median.
- **Result**: Identified vehicles that are more fuel-efficient than the median, aiding in performance analysis.

## Conclusion

These exercises demonstrate advanced data manipulation techniques using the MPG dataset, providing insights into vehicle types, fuel economy, and enhancing data analysis capabilities. ðŸš€# MPG-Dataset-in-Python
